Tide Schedule Project
==============================================================

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, we made this application in the context of a tutored project.
This application has been coded in Java.

##### What is the purpose of this application? 

The goal of this application is to display the information of the tides of a port, according to the date, selected from the calendar of 2021. It is possible to choose among 10 ports of the Channel and the Atlantic. A tide is identified by 4 information: its time, its water height, its coefficient and its type.

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
##### First step

You must download the application file. To do this click on the Github logo below.

[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Octicons-mark-github.svg/2048px-Octicons-mark-github.svg.png" alt="drawing" width="40" heigth="40"/>](https://github.com/arthurpellegrini/tide-schedule)

Then go to the green "code" button and select "download zip".

##### Second step

Finally, you will have to execute this sequence of commands in a terminal to launch the application:

```sh
$ javac -cp build/classes -d build/classes
$ (find src -name "*.java")
$ java -cp build/classes Window
```
If everything went well, the application should have launched, you just have to test our application !

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------

The application has three tabs on the main window. 
The first tab allows to choose a date on a calendar.
The second tab allows you to choose the port and displays a table containing the data on the 4 tides of the day.
And the last tab displays the water level hour by hour for the date and the port chosen previously.
